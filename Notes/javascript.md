Javascript
==========

The book [Engineering Software as a Service](http://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Software-Service-Approach-Computing-ebook/dp/B00CCEHNUM) discusses the four major uses of javascript:

1. **Client-side javascript** - The server returns an HTML page containing javascript that will respond to various actions by replacing pieces of the page. The javascript modifies the Document Object Model (DOM) so that the visible page changes in the browser.
2. **Single-page applications (SPA)** - The server provides HTML and javascript, and the javascript acts as a web service client by making requests to the server and refreshing portions of the page.
3. **Client-side applications** - Applications like Google Docs use javascript to implement complex client-side software. Frameworks such as [Angular](https://angularjs.org/) make it easy for the developer to implement these kinds of applications.
4. **Server-side appications** - Server-side applications can also be built using javascript, and the node.js framework is popular for this use.

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a commonly-used javascript library that makes it easier for the js programmer to perform common tasks.
